# MgtPrimer

MgtPrimer is a software program to design mouse genotyping primers across several genotyping platforms. MgtPrimer generates PCR primers for SYBR melting curve assays, size-difference electrophoresis, and universal fluorescent energy-transfer (FRET) assays. By providing primers for several genotyping platforms at once, MgtPrimer saves time and cost while facilitating accurate and successful mouse genotyping.
